The get_features_pano Matlab function will render and write 3 panorama views to a single image file

The function takes in two arguments: 
    1) 3D Mesh File (.stl,.obj, or .off)
    2) output image file

To run, open Matlab, cd to this directory, then run panorama_generation(input_3D_file,output_image_file)

This can take as little as a couple seconds to run for small files, and minutes for larger files.
