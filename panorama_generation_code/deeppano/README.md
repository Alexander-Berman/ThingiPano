# DeepPano Panorama Projection Code

This scipts are used in [1] for rendering panorama views. For a standard 3D shape mesh(see the example file `chair_0890.off` and `bed_0001.off`), it will take around 1 second for rendering panorama view with size of 500x300 (Test on a standard PC with Intel Xeon CPU E3-1230 v2 @3.3GHz 3.7GHz).

For rendering a panoview, please run `exp_proj_panoview.m`
