The unit will fit spools up to 202mm in diameter and up to about 80mm thick.  \nThe spools rest on two rotating spindles, which in turn reside in two pairs of 608ZZ bearings. This gives very smooth filament payout.   \nOn the top of the unit is a hydration box. The hydration box is meant to hold silica gel to keep the filament dry. It is recommended to use colour changing silica gel, so that you will know when it needs to be refreshed/changed. To this end, it is recommended to print the top box cover in something transparent such as Taulman T-Glase so that you can see the gel colour.   \nThe filament exits the top of the unit via the filament cleaning unit, denoted by the pink aperture. It is recommended to cut a piece of foam/sponge to size, and to wedge it into the top box from below. The storage area for the cleaning material tapers up from the bottom, thus ensuring that it stays in place.  \nUnits can also be stacked next to each other, and a vertical arrangement is also in the works.\n"}, {"header": "Instructions", "text": "At the moment, the unit is at the design stage.

>Print hexagon sides  </li>\n<li >Glue one side of the side plate to the hexagon  </li>\n\nAll other parts should be snap fit into the main structure thereafter.   \n608ZZ bearings are used for the

A little extra force downward on the bed actually forces the back bottom wheel off the rail because the distance of the third wheel is too close to the other two wheels.

You should consider fixing your old printer with the parts needed for the D-bot. For instance, if your hot end is clogged to all hell, buy the E3D and install it on your current printer to get it printing. Same could be said with the logic board, power supply, lead screws etc. Once you have all the D-bot parts printed, remove the borrowed parts and build your D-Bot.

Think of it as a beefed-up version of the Mosfets on the Ramps board that send electricity to the hot-end. A 5v logic signal from the arduino is sent to the mosfet, and in turn the mosfet allows for 12v to flow to the hotend. The same theory applies with a SSR, however, instead of sending 12V to the hotend (or in this case heated bed) the SSR can deliver 120V (mains power right from your wall). Yes it will heat the bed more quickly BUT ONLY if you have a 120V heated bed. If you have a standard 12V PCB heated bed you will break it by wiring it to a SSR using mains power. The advantages of using a SSR are twofold. The first is that for two beds with equivalent power ratings (watts) the one using the SSR will draw significantly less amperage than the one driven from the mosfets on the ramps board, and you won't have to worry as much about your wires heating up. The second is that the power that is used to heat the bed doesn't come from the printer's power supply, but instead right from the wall. The power supply listed in the BOM will struggle to get your bed very hot if it has to run a large heated bed, considering it also has to supply power to all of the stepper motors and the hotend in the printer. Please make sure if you do get a SSR that you are comfortable working with mains power as you will have to supply 120V right to the relay.

The SSR stays cool to the touch even after a 24hr print. Let me also mention the fact that the first silicone heater I tried was cheaper in price and seemed to be of good quality but something was wrong with it because I blew 2 fuses before concluding that it was bad and therefore too dangerous to even try another fuse. I checked the wiring again and again to just make sure it was done correctly, which I knew was already correct but when something happens like that I suppose you tend to second guess yourself.

I turned the printer off around 80 degrees before it started getting out of hand. No light on the SSR, and PID tuning essentially failed because it was too high of a temp. I double-triple checked all wiring involving the heatbed, and the first time around I verified that it had a normal ambient temp that matched the hotend.

Most pre-assembly t-nuts have this neck area also, and can't be used with raised channels on the printed parts without risk of bottoming before engaging the extrusion.", "author": "geoxile", "comment_id": "944801", "author_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/KDan", "depth": "2", "parent": "939234", "author_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/47/94/ac/ad/23/PGasser_thumb_small.jpg", "date": "Jul 23, 2016 1:13 pm"}, {"text": "8 bux for a 100, took a week to arrive.

Remember that both the nuts and plastic parts have elevated profiles to compensate the extrusion slot empty space.  When both profiles are in touch there won't be enough movement to tight the plastic part, extrusion and nut ending with loose joints.

If the spool middle diameter is 155mm,  1kg filament will turn about 852 circles.(Maybe there are more accurate computing methods). So you can record the cirlces of filament to know how many filament you have used.<br />\nFor each new filament, you can turn each dial plate to let the pointer point to zero, which can be called resetting. Or, you may not do this, just let it count the circles.<br />\nYou may have to buy some bearings, wich MODEL are 618-5 and 61803.<br />\nThe number of dial plate is 4.<br />\nThe number of  interval_gear_2 is 2.<br />\nThe number of cursor is 4.<br />\nThe number of expander is 4.<br />\nThe number of spring is 2.<br />\nThe number of bearing 61803 is 2.<br />\nThe number of bearing

I SMooSHED the first layer of the disk onto the print bed to get a nicely fused object. I cleaned the trigger pivot with a 1/8&quot; drill, and the rubber band anchor pin hole 3/32&quot;.   \nInitially designed in Tinkercad, you will find an OpenSCAD routine to allow fine tuning of the disk for the peculiarities of a given printer.  \nAssembly should be self-evident.  Glue the barrel on top of the grip, with your favorite bonding agent.  The rubber bands attach to the launcher (the small block with holes), pass through the wings at the front of the barrel and around the pin at the front of the trigger (see pictures).  The trigger pivots on a pin through the front of the grip, and another pin secures the rubberbands, pulling the trigger firmly into place. You will have to clean out the support from the trigger slot on the grip.  \nClip off the tip of the skewer's point and twist it into the hole in the disk. The fit should be snug, but loose at the launcher end.  Cut the bamboo skewer to an appropriate length given the strength of your rubber bands, weighing the trade-offs of inertia, accuracy, and acceleration for longer or shorter skewers.  \nI found my skewers to be very thick, so I drilled out the barrel to 3/16 inch. The Launcher should be just as loose on the skewer.   \nThe trigger hook is a little fiddly, but I haven't had one absolutely not work, yet.  If you can't get it to latch, try rotating the disk a couple of degrees.  \nHappy Hunting!\n"}], "tags": [["flies", "tag:flies"], ["fly", "tag:fly"], ["fly_gun", "tag:fly_gun"], ["fly_shooter", "tag:fly_shooter"], ["fly_swatter", "tag:fly_swatter"], ["fun", "tag:fun"], ["gun", "tag:gun"], ["Jedi", "tag:Jedi"], ["pests", "tag:pests"], ["shooter", "tag:shooter"], ["swatter", "tag:Swatter"], ["Tinkercad", "tag:TinkerCAD"]], "published_datetime": "2013-06-11 19:07:48 GMT", "banner_challenge_winner": false, "images": ["https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/10/8c/73/73/84/L1020778_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/75/97/1e/92/fa/L1020850_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/af/23/2d/55/0b/L1020856_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/4b/56/0b/b0/41/L1020854_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/be/ca/b8/48/bc/openscad_smoosher_disk_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/db/b6/c5/b4/97/smoosher_plated_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/8f/ef/20/c1/13/grip_raw_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/ce/66/0f/88/2e/L1020773_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/14/46/93/bc/69/L1020770_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/c2/b0/33/0a/f5/smoosher3_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/37/99/de/3a/eb/smoosher2_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/fe/7c/04/c6/30/barrel_raw_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/7b/62/24/77/95/disk_raw_preview_featured.jpg"], "remixes_number": "4", "author_url_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/25/78/18/49/e0/schlem_minus_thumb_small.jpg", "comments": [{"text": "very funny....<br />\nprinted well, works great!", "author": "UweG", "comment_id": "921761", "author_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/UweG", "depth": "1", "parent": null, "author_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/5a/d9/73/cb/8d/IMG_0743_thumb_small.JPG", "date": "Jun 25, 2016 7:46 pm"}, {"text": "awesome!", "author": "TTB_Studios", "comment_id": "429537", "author_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/TTB_Studios", "depth": "1", "parent": null, "author_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/97/84/a9/23/3c/HELL_thumb_small.jpg", "date": "Oct 27, 2013 3:49 am"}, {"text": "Very nice.

The tail rotates up and over. The pincers also rotate and, when squeezed, open to grab onto things. Another fun print!  \nRefer to instructions for print settings to ensure it is strong enough. NO SUPPORT REQUIRED.  \nAfter printing, carefully snap/cut away the Raft so you don't damage the legs or Pincers in particular. As soon as the Raft is removed the tail should rotate up and over the Scorpionz back and Princers move and nip/grab onto things. Take care when you first rotate the pincers so they break away cleanly. Just a gentle wriggle / twist should clean it away fine.   \nThe standard design print is approx. 17 cm in length. This could be scaled up but scaling down will not work as it will affect internal clearances and could also make the joints too weak.   \nThere is also a 'short' version (15.7cmlong) available which has one less link in the tail. It still works fine and will enable Scorpionz to be printed on machines with smaller build plates. If rotated to 45 degrees, the model will fit on a build plate measuring 13cm x 13cm.  \nNote: If you like this check out all my other designs and post pictures of your prints!   \n'Z-REX' <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1594269\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1594269</a>\n'Ratz' <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1532944\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1532944</a>\nSharkz <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:910216\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:910216</a>  \n'Crocz' <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:941177\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:941177</a>   \n'Woodpeckerz' <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1155168\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1155168</a>\n'Eaglez' <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:963892\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:963892</a>   \n'Catz' <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:988088\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:988088</a>   \n"}, {"header": "Instructions", "text": "This should print well on most 3D printers.

So if you get an odd measurement like 63mm... You'll add 10mm to get 73mm... What you will need to do is simply round up and take the 75mm rods...

I didn't spend too much time on the design to really dive into making it multi-functional.", "author": "DropperX", "comment_id": "1111000", "author_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/jjpowelly", "depth": "2", "parent": "1109943", "author_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/ab/b0/bd/32/b0/1186331_10151839492868523_1503214809_n_thumb_small.jpg", "date": "Dec 30, 2016 9:21 pm"}, {"text": "Do you need to use supports when printing?", "author": "DASFREAK", "comment_id": "1048388", "author_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/DASFREAK", "depth": "1", "parent": null, "author_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/08/94/2e/39/00/f28ee53860f5f8a795df0cdace70e6e2_thumb_small.jpg", "date": "Nov 12, 2016 5:07 pm"}, {"text": "could you make increments with lengths of up to 200 mm?

So if your measurement was 65mm from end to end - you're going to want 75mm rods... The extra 10mm is to account for the 7-8mm lost when the rod screws into the base arm... I did this to add strength to the holder... But you have to keep it in mind and account for it...  \nAll of my rods are in 5mm increments from 40-110mm in length... So, 40,45,50,55,60,etc... So if you get an odd measurement like 63mm... You'll add 10mm to get 73mm... What you will need to do is simply round up and take the 75mm rods...

I did this to add strength to the holder... But you have to keep it in mind and account for it...  \nAll of my rods are in 5mm increments from 40-110mm in length... So, 40,45,50,55,60,etc... So if you get an odd measurement like 63mm... You'll add 10mm to get 73mm... What you will need to do is simply round up and take the 75mm rods...

prototype, I've used a DECT station connector for the power supply.

I use a Skywalker X8 and have two sockets mounted at each end of the fuselage looking down. I use a Nikon Coolpix L22 for RGB images and a Fujifilm A180 for UV and NIR images. Either camera can be mounted in each socket depending on the flight configuration required. I often just fly with only one camera in the front and have the choice of quickly fitting either.

You might be more interested in the new one : <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1190481\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1190481</a>\nThe original SmartrapCore 1.2x (I currently use V. 1.24) slideX part is very well designed and effective, but in the process of designing a project for a twin-headed version of it (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:995640\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:995640</a>) I got some ideas that seemed to be usefully adaptable to the single-headed regular parts, at least with one goal in mind : putting the printing zone cooling fan and fanduct on the rear of the head block. Hence this new design\u2026  \nThe main idea here is to remove the printing zone cooling system from the front, in order to have a wider and more comfortable view of the nozzle and the printing in progress, which I believe is quite essential.  \nWarning : as it means that the fanduct part takes some space behind the slideX, this might not work if you're using the regular slideZ support system, or at least you might need to give up two or three centimeters on the Y axis to avoid collisions with the upper slideZ support. If you adopted Andreas' Z system (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:896556\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:896556</a>) then this back fanduct won't be a problem.  \nImportant : this is a research, a work in progress.

If not, put 2 M3 x 20 bolts instead. In both cases, that'll also help tightening the slideZ on the LM8 linear bearings.  \nRemember to put an M3 nut in the upper-left corner nut cavity of the fanduct before you install it, you'll need that later to install the fan on the fanduct.  \nUse 2 M3 x 20 bolts (and nuts) to install the hot end 40mm fan on its support, before you install the support, with 2 M3 x 25 bolts (and nuts) on the slideX main body part (you have to do it in that order, otherwise you won't have room to put the nuts that holds the fan in their cavities).  \nInstall the second 40mm fan on the rear fanduct, using 4 M3 x 16 bolts (and nuts), and an M3 x 10 (or 12, or even 16 if you don't have a shorter one) bolt (and nut) to tighten the endstopX switch, and that should be all\u2026 :)\n"}], "tags": [["fanduct", "tag:fanduct"], ["SmartrapCore", "tag:SmartrapCore"], ["X_Axis_Carriage", "tag:X_Axis_Carriage"]], "published_datetime": "2015-09-06 13:18:11 GMT", "banner_challenge_winner": false, "images": ["https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/be/12/73/08/33/sc124_newSlideX_byBB01_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/48/d1/c6/88/d4/sc124_newSlideX_byBB03_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/89/bd/af/4a/e6/sc124_newSlideX_byBB04_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/d0/de/b1/f2/b1/sc124_newSlideX_byBB_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/e9/e9/e9/98/09/sc124_newSlideX_byBB_fan-Zsensor_support_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/82/bc/4c/8d/9c/sc124_newSlideX_byBB_fanduct_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/44/4b/7a/22/86/sc124_newSlideX_byBB02_preview_featured.jpg"], "remixes_number": "0", "author_url_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/fd/86/87/49/fc/HoneyBear_BassPlayer_avatar_thumb_small.jpg", "comments": [{"text": "Hello Bruno,", "author": "marcething", "comment_id": "713686", "author_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/marcething", "depth": "1", "parent": null, "author_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/44/bb/0f/5a/04/27bc5a2294965dc9b79b069a011aa878_thumb_small.jpg", "date": "Oct 31, 2015 3:59 pm"}, {"text": "Hello !<br />\nThe new (3.0) version is now available with the option for 8mm/LM8UU : <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1190481\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1190481</a> :)", "author": "marcething", "comment_id": "744063", "author_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/BrunoBellamy", "depth": "2", "parent": "713686", "author_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/fd/86/87/49/fc/HoneyBear_BassPlayer_avatar_thumb_small.jpg", "date": "Dec 14, 2015 9:38 am"}, {"text": "I'm afraid making an 8mm axes version would be much more complicated than simply making room for the LM8UU bearings, because it's a rather compact design, which means I'd have to test several things by printing them to make sure it works fine.<br />\nThe problem is that I don't have (yet) an 8mm axes SmartrapCore.

The corner blocks are best laying flat with the diamond hole side up, wait till it almost finishes the long hole going lateral through it and sit there with it using a micro torch warming a corner of the drywall knife and batt down the curls if your machine is prone to this. Without getting in the extruder's way. Not too hot, just warm enough to articulate it down, the other method is to follow behind it and keep the blade cool. Torch method is only used in a \"oh no, I'm going to get a shift situation\"  I didn't use rafts or infill on any of the parts. Corner blocks are the hardest, it's better to do just one at a time, or it will hit a \"wall\" and shift the whole thing. The x motor mount is best printed standing up, fat side down. M8 and fender washers can be printed and used successfully on this build. 6 fender, and 2 trays of 50 m8. Print Y pulleys with nut inserts from the remix section, use them instead. Aluminum bed, kapton tape, hairspray, tap with drywall knife to release. Whatever pulleys you plan to use, you have to print them in a lot of maybe 3-4 depending on size, if big just do 2 close to one another, z axis motor should be flipped up like mentioned in the root2 group, it works better!

To make bigger you have to use the steel 3ft stock. So you will have 3x3 ft. with an actual milling area of 650mm x 650mm. Under remixes you will have to print the pulleys with the nut inserts for the Y axis. All other pulleys buy aluminum if you can. Some ideas to save money would be to print a couple trays of washers, Buy network cable at the flea market and cut the ends off.

I'm going with 915mm or 3ft long sections of steel square rod instead of the aluminum. They sell either one at Home Depot. I think the aluminum will bow and not be reliable. It's heavier but not by much, so I'm offsetting the weight difference by using pieces of bamboo flooring it's 10.5mm thick and at the specified size of the piece I can't even flex it. The X axis doesn't look like it has a loop so it would be a little longer than the width of the machine. So with mine I would probably need 6.5 feet of belt for each side and 3.5 for the width. As for the firmware I would try Marlin like you would use for a Prusa i2. Slave the 2 Y axis motors together into a single plug to plug into the Y connection. A CNC is just an oversized 3D printer. I've been looking around and I'm hearing that belt driven cnc isn't very accurate, so I'm toying with the idea of using bicycle chain for the Y axis. If anyone out there knows if this is possible please speak up so we will know what to do. Have you printed any parts? Some of the parts I've printed don't look like what is shown. There is a gap between the wood and the y bearing carriage, I don't see how this is attached to the wood. The nuts holding the bearings are getting in the way, they are locking nuts, but I always use locking nuts for bearings. I'm thinking of getting some metal and bending it around this bearing cage and screw that to the wood and screw the metal to the tops and bottoms of the bearing carriage. There is 4 holes on the top and bottom, I know this is for the dust guards but I see no other way. I'm almost done printing, if I can complete this, I will make a youtube video so we all can see how to make it. I really think the span is too great for a belt. I would trust a foot but no more than that. Maybe a lead screw attached to the side of the wood and configure the motors different to accommodate this. Maybe break off the left side of a prusa i2 spring loaded nut trap and attach that to the wood and use 5/16 threaded rod and change the movement in the firmware like it was the z.

If you're interested in saving a little material the hollow design seems to be working fine but I'm sure the solid one would provide additional support.    \nIncluded is the original Cubify Design file for those interested in modifications.  \n"}], "tags": [["road_name", "tag:road_name"], ["road_sign", "tag:road_sign"], ["sign_clamp", "tag:sign_clamp"], ["street_name", "tag:street_name"], ["Street_Sign", "tag:Street_Sign"]], "published_datetime": "2015-09-06 15:09:06 GMT", "banner_challenge_winner": false, "images": ["https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/23/18/02/b0/27/Street_Sign_Clamp_CURVED_10_in_-_Cubify_Design_2014_962015_91128_AM.bmp_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/a4/41/57/1c/90/Street_Sign_Clamp_FLAT_SOLID_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/3f/62/ea/2e/05/Street_Sign_Clamp_CURVED_10_in_HOLLOW_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/b0/85/b7/8b/d3/Street_Sign_Clamp_FLAT_HOLLOW_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/0e/e2/c0/f6/70/Street_Sign_Clamp_CURVED_10_in_SOLID_preview_featured.jpg"], "remixes_number": "0", "author_url_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/e4/0d/3a/61/a1/IMG_4677-001_thumb_small.JPG", "comments": [], "liked_by": [{"user_img": "https://www.thingiverse.com/img/default/avatar/avatar_default_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/sebbreton", "user": "sebbreton"}, {"user_img": "https://www.thingiverse.com/img/default/avatar/avatar_default_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/JMR_20_09_01", "user": "JMR_20_09_01"}, {"user_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/52/9b/4e/d9/0a/d4243b2d6ca86e479e25a1746e1ac940_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/drato", "user": "drato"}, {"user_img": "https://www.thingiverse.com/img/default/avatar/avatar_default_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/jb41", "user": "jb41"}, {"user_img": "https://www.thingiverse.com/img/default/avatar/avatar_default_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/rmike", "user": "rmike"}, {"user_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/0c/ae/b7/10/f4/Logo1_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/GyroHeat", "user": "GyroHeat"}, {"user_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/67/f4/23/57/90/image_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/geakjhuu040", "user": "geakjhuu040"}, {"user_img": "https://www.thingiverse.com/img/default/avatar/avatar_default_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/rrssll", "user": "rrssll"}, {"user_img": "https://www.thingiverse.com/img/default/avatar/avatar_default_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/krisranes", "user": "krisranes"}, {"user_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/6a/cb/1c/ff/39/photo_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/Witchboxy", "user": "Witchboxy"}, {"user_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/44/c9/2f/09/30/Sherlock-Holmes_THUMB_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/Sherlock_Filechecker", "user": "Sherlock_Filechecker"}, {"user_img": "https://www.thingiverse.com/img/default/avatar/avatar_engineer_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/porter448", "user": "porter448"}], "id": "1001515", "made_number": "0", "category": "/household/outdoor-and-garden", "banner_verified": false, "author": "dyonkin", "author_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/dyonkin", "likes": "12", "collection_number": "18"}, {"print_settings": {}, "banner_featured": false, "remixed_from": [], "notice_violation": false, "banner_education": false, "files": [{"updated_timestamp": "09-06-15", "file_id": "1580893", "thing_id": "1001516", "download_link": "https://www.thingiverse.com/download:1580893", "img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/bd/74/ed/c6/a4/THNG_PAC1_preview_tinycard.jpg", "filename": "THNG_PAC1.stl", "file_name": "THNG_PAC1.stl", "size": "1mb", "downloads": "213"}, {"updated_timestamp": "09-06-15", "file_id": "1580894", "thing_id": "1001516", "download_link": "https://www.thingiverse.com/download:1580894", "img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/52/55/25/7c/ee/NECKLACXELOOP_preview_tinycard.jpg", "filename": "NECKLACXELOOP.stl", "file_name": "NECKLACXELOOP.stl", "size": "64kb", "downloads": "178"}], "customizer": false, "watches": "0", "makes": [], "title": "Tupac Shakur medallion and necklace loop", "notice_moderation": false, "downloads": "252", "notice_wip": false, "views": "988", "license": "Creative Commons - Attribution - Share Alike", "comments_number": "1", "description": [{"header": "Summary", "text": "This is a Tupac necklace medallion and necklace loop.

So i made this motorized version. It's dead simple, two cheap toy motors rotate the wheel when there is enough pull on the filament.<br />\nThe pull is detected by two microswitches, either one of them switches current to the motors. This way you never have to turn anything on or off. The filament feeder accepts different size of reels without having to adjust bolts and nuts.  \nEverything is purpose designed in OpenSCAD, with the parameters defined up front, so you can easily modify things yourself if you want to.

All parts where designed on the go, so while the build progressed it became clear what was needed. And thanks to 3d-printing it's so easy to create just that part that's needed.

cable, and also allow the phone to be positioned horizontal or vertical.  The design allow for thickness adjustment and it is composed by several flat pieces, easy to print to get the most quality on the external surfaces.\nUPDATED (2/10/2016): new screw and back support with better clearances to allow for different printing precisions.  Please let me know if you have problems with the screw.\n"}, {"header": "Instructions", "text": "To build this you will need the six STL files included in this Thing.

You will notice that there is a Left and a Right side: this is to print them so that the external surface be on top, to get the highest print quality on most printers.  I printed my pieces in 0.2 mm layers to get the screw and the back support to work ok, and also to get the precision to get a smooth surface.  \n(note: after uploading the Right/Left parts to Thingiverse it seems in the display that they are the same -they are- but they were positioned differently in the STL.
