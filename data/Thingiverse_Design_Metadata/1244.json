The figures<br />\nSo I started with the figures. The dwarfen clan from pocket tactics fulfilled all the dwarfish needs I had, and provides different dwarfes so my army wouldnt look as uniform. They needed to be scaled up, and since I didnt wanted to glue their halfes together I merged the halfes into standing pieces that printed without support properly.  \nOnce I hade the dwarfes, I had the scale for the rest of the game. With a 30mm base they needed board tiles with at least 45 mm width/length.<br />\nThe trolls ares loosely based on the rockfrog things I tinkered around with them in blender to make them more ... trolly.<br />\nMy wife painted the figures with meticolous details in full color, but I opted for a antique gold/silver/copper look halfway through, so sorry for the late decision honey.  \nB. The board<br />\nHere started the trouble. I took the 'Interlocking Board Game Tiles' Library,  and scaled it up to 150% to fit my needs for 45mm tiles.<br />\nThe board became huge. And I had to print a ton of tiles for it. To achive a certain 'antique/used' look, I started to print the tiles on ABS slurry, black slurry for the white tiles and vice versa.<br />\nThe result is pretty nice. Because I use a dual-head printer (Leapfrog Creatr Dual Extruder), I wanted to make some special tile-lids for the initial positions of the figures.<br />\nAnd for an 'antiqish' discworld boardgame I searched for celtic motives and found the trisquele and the triquetra. They are not neccessary for the game itself, but look great.  \nC.
