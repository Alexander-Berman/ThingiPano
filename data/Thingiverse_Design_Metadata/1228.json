Open source 3D printer. Simple with less materials. Frame is made of a single 4' long, 2 1/2&quot; square tube (16 gauge/1.5mm/.0598&quot; thick, cost: less then $20.00). With the design there is less plastic parts, stronger structure, all wires are hidden, and a more appealing/finish look. The blue print file will get you more familiar with the construction of the unit. The downloadable file is my blue print that I designed and used to build the machine. The accuracy is to the exact of my build.<br />\nFor more images and updates like:<br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Eventorbot/111169638934671\" >https://www.facebook.com/pages/Eventorbot/111169638934671</a>\nThe unit is supposed to resemble a robotic arm with hydraulic tubes. It was designed for prints to be less affected by vibrations. With the 1 solid frame, any vibrations of any axis will cause the other axis to move with it. For example: If the X axis causes a slight vibration/1mm movement to the right, the Z and Y axis will also move that 1mm to the right. This will result in a better print as everything will remain squared.\nFor those who do not have access to a 3D printer. You can order the plastic parts and frame at: kickstarter.com/projects/1874396831/eventorbot-open-source-3d-printer\nEventorbot has met its funding goal!\nWell, I'm speechless and overwhelmed with all the support. I will like to say a BIG thank you for all the support, kind words, and to all the backers. To be able to share and have your interest in something I created is a great feeling. Everyone of you guys have made something that was a big dream become reality. Eventorbot, as a 3D printer is now going to happen! You will have no regrets in owning a Eventorbot, our machine will be a strong contender.\nThank you... thank you... thank you...\n"}, {"header": "Instructions", "text": "Attached are Google SketchUp/SKB files.

The reason for this STL remix was all the comments from the community (as well as myself) so i just decided to design a few more and make STL files out of it. Hope you have as much fun printing it as I did.\n"}, {"header": "Instructions", "text": "I printed mine at 3mm layer height at 60mm/s and they came out great.   \nEach side and coaster is 5mm in height, but I also added files if you wanted to print just one solid side.

suppressor/silencer in blender. I made three of them with 14mm negative threads so it will fit most airsoft guns. The sizes are 30x80mm, 38x80mm, and 38x120mm and I also made a threaded adapter to fit airsoft pistols. I have only tested it on the p90 and i'm planing to test it on other airsoft guns later. Print with no support and use standard print height 0.2mm. Tested the 38x120mm suppressor today and had some lower than normal shots. Upon checking the suppressor there was some wear from the airsoft bbs making contact with the suppressor. So i made a new version of the 38x120mm with a wider opening by about a couple of millimeters. The smaller 30x80mm did not have any problems.<br />\nUpdate: Tried the adapter on a WE 1911 that had a threaded barrel with the orange tip pulled off. It didn't work due to size and further research revealed that the pistol threads are 11mm positive thread. Just posted the pistol adapter 11mm positive to 14mm negative. Working on flash hiders, when i get some good prints i will post them. Added a reinforced pistol adapter due to one of my friends easily breaking it. If it does break off in the pistol barrel it can easily be cut out with a hobby knife. I've also added a threaded spacer. Added new pistol adapter version 2 with better threads. I have printed it and the threads look better but have not tested it yet.<br />\nAdded 24mm positive thread versions  to work with some ak47-74 types. Added a new suppressor 45mm x 240mm, due to size I had to make it in two parts.\n"}], "tags": [["14mm", "tag:14mm"], ["24mm", "tag:24mm"], ["adapter", "tag:adapter"], ["Airsoft", "tag:airsoft"], ["Silencer", "tag:silencer"], ["suppressor", "tag:Suppressor"], ["Suppressors", "tag:Suppressors"], ["Threaded", "tag:threaded"]], "published_datetime": "2014-04-04 03:05:39 GMT", "banner_challenge_winner": false, "images": ["https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/ed/87/29/32/38/IM000248_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/30/db/24/fe/d4/SuppressorShort24mm_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/59/03/d2/56/73/SuppressorLong24mm_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/bc/1f/22/72/01/PistolAdapterV2_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/87/05/e1/49/94/PistolAdapterReinforcedV2_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/7f/28/e6/68/88/Spacer_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/42/50/72/d2/60/PistolAdapterReinforced_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/c5/b6/e3/1d/df/PistolAdapter_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/be/ee/3d/2f/72/IM000250_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/e0/06/d8/2a/e1/IM000249_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/1c/f8/b7/47/c5/ThreadAdapter_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/22/33/7e/f8/8f/Suppressor38x120mm_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/33/6a/22/98/ef/Suppressor38x80mm_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/f8/90/43/a6/1c/Suppressor30x80mm_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/d2/05/34/a8/77/Suppressor38x120mm_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/d5/69/a7/39/01/Suppressor38x80mm_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/dd/19/fd/55/2c/Suppressor30x80mm_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/00/e5/bf/7d/de/IM000246_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/9a/d1/a1/11/85/IM000243_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/78/a0/af/0e/f1/BigOneUpper_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/d7/bb/47/25/dc/BigOneLower_preview_featured.jpg"], "remixes_number": "0", "author_url_img": "https://www.thingiverse.com/img/default/avatar/avatar_default_thumb_small.jpg", "comments": [{"text": "how did you make the threading for your project?
