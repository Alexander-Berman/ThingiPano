I've also seen a similar belt tensioner on the TypeAMachines Series 1.  \nBut to install it on your Printrbot Simple you:<br />\n1) Get your fishing line belt as tight as you can get it.<br />\n2) Then, print out this part (it will still print at slower speeds with decent results as there are not accelerations large enough to cause the x-axis to slip.<br />\n3) Weave the belt in between the gaps in the serpentine part; making sure you keep the belt inside the gaps and that the piece is as close to the nuts holding the fishing wire as possible (otherwise the piece will possibly get sucked into the motor axis--not good).<br />\n4) Start printing nice and clean parts!\n"}], "tags": [], "published_datetime": "2014-04-04 07:21:49 GMT", "banner_challenge_winner": false, "images": ["https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/23/47/30/bb/dd/2014-04-04_00.02.17_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/de/29/5b/ed/13/2014-04-04_00.04.01_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/97/1d/3d/17/7b/printrbot-simple-belt-tensioner-03mm-wn_preview_featured.jpg"], "remixes_number": "0", "author_url_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/f6/64/f1/50/09/logos-from-twitter_thumb_small.jpg", "comments": [{"text": "this is brilliant!
