"Summary", "text": "This file is designed to create  adapters to connect shop or household vacuum hoses of any diameter with tools with any size round tool ports.\nYou can use Customizer to specify the inside or outside diameter of each end as well as the length of each segment.  The adapter has a ring on the outside of the large section to provide a grip to pull it off the hose/tool.  You can specify an optional internal ring at the lower end of the small section to keep a tool from being sucked into the adapter.\nAll dimensions are entered in mm.  (Note: Customizer seems NOT to like trailing zeros in decimal dimensions; so enter dimensions as 10.1 or 10.13, NOT 10.10 or 10.130.)\n"}, {"header": "Print Settings", "text": "<strong >Printer Brand: </strong>\n                     <p >MakerBot</p>\n<strong >Printer: </strong>\n                     <p ><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2rjq0gC\" target=\"_blank\" >MakerBot Replicator 2X</a></p>\n<strong >Rafts: </strong>\n                     <p >No</p>\n<strong >Supports: </strong>\n                     <p >No</p>\n<strong >Infill: </strong>\n                     <p >10%</p>\n\n<strong >Notes: </strong>\n                    \n-- 10% infill seems strong enough for my needs printing in ABS. You may want to adjust that.\n-- If the tapered section is too short (i.e. it prints at a relatively flat angle) you may need redesign your adapter or use print supports.\n-- I find my printer has its own interpretation of dimensions sometimes (particularly &quot;small&quot; holes; e.g. an internal dimensions I specified as 11.5mm actually printed as 10.8mm. So, you may need to fiddle with your dimensions to fit your printer's view of reality. Or a quick touch with a round file may be all the adjustment you need.\nAs a quick test, you can specify the critical dimension for the &quot;large&quot; end and stop the print after 20 layers or so you can measure what the printer actually doing.\n"}], "tags": [["customizer", "tag:customizer"], ["Vacuum_Adapter", "tag:Vacuum_Adapter"], ["Vacuum_Hose_Adapter", "tag:Vacuum_Hose_Adapter"]], "published_datetime": "2016-01-05 15:00:38 GMT", "banner_challenge_winner": false, "images": ["https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/d7/b6/b4/a8/08/d6702b328d6df9bbef077ec81129a4de_preview_featured.JPG"], "remixes_number": "325", "author_url_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/f2/93/77/53/dd/09609b1d10a5913141fa4cd86c6c3586_thumb_small.jpg", "comments": [{"text": "thanks for this, love the fact i can customize it.<br />\nExcept the cutomizer wont work!", "author": "Fodder1", "comment_id": "1724645", "author_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/Fodder1", "depth": "1", "parent": null, "author_img": "https://www.thingiverse.com/img/default/avatar/avatar_default_thumb_small.jpg", "date": "Jan 28, 2018 4:14 am"}, {"text": "Chris.

Power resistors are designed to operate at high temperatures. Resistors like this one are designed to operate safely at over 150C, so 60C is not all that warm.However, that is why the instructions note that it should be up and away from the board. If it were close to the board the board itself could be damaged by the heat.  I assume that you put the board on the side of the Z-axis as recommended, where it can get at least some cooling air.

So I thought I couldn't have connected the heater to the wrong jst connector in the toranado (if that makes sense). I then set my extruder temp to 100 degrees C and all fans died for a half a second. Then there was a big cloud of smoke and flames streaking my board =( . That's why I think it had to do with the extruder heater, but I guess it could have been anything with power regulation coming to think of it, as there seems to have been a big power surge when heater activated. Checked the board more thoroughly this morning and it seems to originate from something between the heated bed screw terminal and the power input terminal.

I had hot end clogging about an hour into the print, every time! ... the solution was to insulate the hot end heater block, using 1\" wide ceramic fabric stuff, wrapped with Kapton tape, covered all six sides of block. The Toranado bed fan shroud wraps around, this creates a somewhat enclosed zone that heats up the heat sink too much at higher nozzle temps (didn't happen with PLA printing at 215C). The insulated block does fit in the available space. NO MORE clogging. Then I noticed that the PETG print quality dramatically improved with use of the bed cooling fan, cranked up. Then I noticed the typical PETG stringing that goes on with PETG, can be dramatically reduced with slight adjustments in Flow Rates, 1-2% reduction can reduce stringing in 1/2 at least.

I recieved everything and dry fitted the bearings. They seem to work pretty well. I am hoping they will hold the weight of the solidoodle bed.   \nThis is an openSCAD adaptation of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:112718\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:112718</a>. The idea is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/MSollack\" title=\"MSollack\" >Mark Sollack's</a> but the code is all mine. I added a quite a few options like support for up to 5 bearings, adjustable bearing size, selectable smooth rod size, customizable mounting holes and more.   \nThe mounting solutions in customizer works for Solidoodles and a few other solutions however, the script can be altered to work with all types of mounting. See instructions for help selecting standard bearing sizes. I commented just about every section in the script so it should be extremely easy to make changes.  \nUpdate:<br />\nMy current prototype as pictured is using 3 x 625zz bearings on 8mm smooth rod. I shorted myself on mounting screw depth on this one so I am in the process of printing another. However, I am getting incredible results out of it so far.  \nUse bearing_tilt at your own risk. This was added as a result of user feedback. I tried it and it seems to not hold as well do to the decreased surface area touching the smooth rod. I will leave it in as an option just incase someone wants to use this on a threaded rod setup. If you wish to increase the tension on the smooth rod then please use the variable &quot;snug&quot;. This will make the bearings squeeze the smooth rod more or less depending on your desires.  \nVideo of it working:<br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXX6AXUATD0\" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXX6AXUATD0</a>  \n"}, {"header": "Instructions"}, {"header": "Suggested Print Settings:", "text": "\n<li >.15 mm layers or smaller  </li>\n<li >3 perimeters minimum   </li>\n<li >100 percent infil*  </li>\n\n*There is a lot of force on the bearings and corresponding bolt. I have observed that over time, the heat will build up and cause the bearings to get looser. Also, the plastic will flex and degrade if the infil is too low. The bolts that hold the bearings in need to be very tight. In order to tighten the bolts up with out the nuts ripping through the plastic, you need to have 100 percent infil.   \nYou can calculate your expected steps/mm <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://calculator.josefprusa.cz/#leadscrew\" title=\"Prusa Calculator3\" >here, credit goes to Josef Prusa for the awesome calculator</a>.   \nStandard bearing sizes that this will work with: (list derived from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.bearingworks.com/bearing_sizes/index.php\" title=\"Bearing Works\" >Bearing Works</a>)<br />\nPN  ID  OD  Width<br />\n603 3   9   3<br />\n604 4   12  4<br />\n605 5   14  5<br />\n606 6   17  6<br />\n623 3   10  4<br />\n624 4   13  5<br />\n625 5   16  5<br />\n626 6   19  6<br />\n633 3   13  5<br />\n634 4   16  5<br />\n635 5   19  6<br />\n636 6   22  7<br />\n673 3   6   2<br />\n674 4   7   2<br />\n675 5   8   2<br />\n676 6   10  2.5<br />\n684 4   9   2.5<br />\n685 5   11  3<br />\n686 6   13  3.5<br />\n693 3   8   3<br />\n694 4   11  4<br />\n695 5   13  4<br />\n696 6   15  5  \n"}], "tags": [["ballscrew", "tag:ballscrew"], ["customizer", "tag:customizer"], ["lead", "tag:lead"], ["lead_screw", "tag:lead_screw"], ["openscad", "tag:openscad"], ["solidoodle", "tag:solidoodle"], ["threadless", "tag:threadless"]], "published_datetime": "2013-07-31 02:59:39 GMT", "banner_challenge_winner": false, "images": ["https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/d4/5f/f7/94/82/threadless_ball_screw_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/a8/4a/56/f0/d0/sample_prints_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/b3/00/47/cc/25/happy_now_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/d7/c5/3e/ee/ef/Prototype_inuse_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/3f/30/bf/ae/ee/threadless_ball_screw_preview_featured.jpg"], "remixes_number": "42", "author_url_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/72/56/ef/d5/0d/carnivorousness-crash-test-dummies-pic-6_thumb_small.jpg", "comments": [{"text": "I've used this to play around and learn openscad, it is incredible and it works great.<br />\nI've changed the angle calculation so that it starts in the middle of the bearing at the contact point so we don't need the angle compensation<br />\nI'll try and organize the file but I've made several attempts and they are quite messy but i'll try to post some photos of the various prints i've done If you or anyone want a copy  email me.<br />\nI've also put an option for fixing a lateral rod to try and use in um / um2 kind of printers and an option for a slot to adjust pressure.", "author": "Lisca", "comment_id": "943573", "author_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/Lisca", "depth": "1", "parent": null, "author_img": "https://www.thingiverse.com/img/default/avatar/avatar_engineer_thumb_small.jpg", "date": "Jul 21, 2016 10:43 pm"}, {"text": "FYI, the Customizer script is <em >completely</em> borked.", "author": "KeithFromCanada", "comment_id": "855335", "author_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/KeithFromCanada", "depth": "1", "parent": null, "author_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/76/db/2c/7f/f7/20140601_214936_Terminal_Ave_N_-_800x800_thumb_small.jpg", "date": "Apr 11, 2016 1:27 am"}, {"text": "I made a lot of changes in your code to fit my needs, really liked it!!

It has been almost 3 months in the making.<br />\nHaving tested countless designs to achieve the lightest and strongest possible construction, this is my final build.<br />\nIt was designed as a complete project incorporating motor and servo mountings, push rods and control horn locations, with interchangeable engine cowling at the firewall. All control surfaces, rudder and elevators are pre-slotted for hinge insertions and can be glued in place with super glue.<br />\nThe air craft is a typical high wing Clark Y-wing section with good dihedral and lots of wing area. This is an easy-to-fly trainer model, not representing any scale design of any kind. It is a popular design for anybody starting out, irrespective that it is a 3d printing exercise in RC modeling.<br />\nThe whole plane is constructed in modules no larger than your Makerbot-type 3d printer. The proto type here in the pictures was created on  so most printers with a compatible print area will suffice.   \n"}, {"header": "Instructions", "text": "Instructions for printing are as follows:-<br />\nTo achieve the weight required the main thing to remember is to keep the fuselage, wings and tail planes set to hollow and extrude only 1 layer into the perimeter. Keep the extrusion ratio down as low as possible.  Other parts such as bulk heads and servo mountings can be solid.     All STL files are presented on opening in their recommended printing orientation.<br />\nI have included a photo tutorial that will help with the assembly procedure.  My plane was manufactured in ABS and then glued together with acetone and supper glue.<br />\nThe hinging of all movable surfaces such as ailerons, elevators and rudders utilize standard CA model plane hinges no wider than 14 mm.<br />\nAlso see photos for servo types and other RC equipment recommended.  \nG-code settings<br />\nname = Yellow PAF<br />\n; layer_thickness_mm = 0.25<br />\n; extrusion_width_mm = 0.5<br />\n; num_loops = 1<br />\n; skin_thickness_mm = 0<br />\n; infill<em >density</em> 0<br />\n; stacked_layers = 1<br />\n; support_density = 0<br />\n; raft_mode = 0  \nThis is an experimental exercise so any improvements and ideas will be very welcome.

Mark the hole 3/8 inches (10 mm) out from the edge of the plate. The drill a 3/16&quot; (5 mm) hole for the screw into the wood.

(DJI H3-3D Standard Version Part42 Damping Shock Absorber Ball)\nThe Bolts I used are stainless steel:<br />\n3x M3 x 20mm HEX button head (for the motor clamps)<br />\n1x M3 x 20mm HEX button head (for the arm1-arm2 connection)<br />\n4x M3 x 8mm   HEX button head (for the motor arm3)<br />\n4x M3 x 6mm   HEX flat head (for the GoPro case)\nI added some additional snapshots of the assembly. I only use the 16 x 19 mm mounting holes of the motors. The housing of the motor is clamped in the different parts.\nOn request I also added the 123dx design file so you can build further on this design.\nShort action video here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://youtu.be/80s-3GhD2zk\" >https://youtu.be/80s-3GhD2zk</a>\nEnjoy!\n"}], "tags": [["brushless", "tag:brushless"], ["camera", "tag:camera"], ["dji", "tag:dji"], ["dji_inspired", "tag:dji_inspired"], ["gimbal", "tag:gimbal"], ["GoPro", "tag:GoPro"], ["inspired", "tag:inspired"], ["Quadcopter", "tag:Quadcopter"]], "published_datetime": "2016-01-05 18:49:23 GMT", "banner_challenge_winner": false, "images": ["https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/9b/31/cc/4a/42/bb9326229714158449c691285b203ab4_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/83/85/9e/ff/e9/821ece2c3e98576eb87f1f1e1fac4e60_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/b7/0f/4b/3b/20/564c6e88150f166901a402e6df957297_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/29/71/ec/f5/9f/cebbf42b03b8b3efce62912d2b5503ad_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/88/e3/ae/e8/73/fc4df6ccc08186e6cf9512eb68fdb4d9_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/40/de/10/4f/b0/6cb8ffe381b2f736251d6571fcfda029_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/b9/b4/55/9c/88/OBGV5_arm3_3-axis_CG_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/54/9e/54/3a/61/OBGV5_arm1_3-axis_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/ee/93/11/2e/42/a7ecc62c2f14c9de5b260e0aaa503662_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/7b/58/9e/fc/d9/5d9f698bce4fd6c0918dfd25dc37a5ea_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/ec/cb/3b/02/56/37574ea8b0a8525690b11f20a5445401_preview_featured.jpg"], "remixes_number": "1", "author_url_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/5b/84/41/a5/54/c9d671b129173bccaaaf4ee298dcdc9a_thumb_small.jpg", "comments": [{"text": "hello, i printed your design, but i'm asking where can i mount the storm32 bgc?", "author": "enthropy92", "comment_id": "1177690", "author_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/enthropy92", "depth": "1", "parent": null, "author_img": "https://www.thingiverse.com/img/default/avatar/avatar_maker_thumb_small.jpg", "date": "Feb 6, 2017 10:23 pm"}, {"text": "I think this is the one.<br /><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.ebay.com/itm/Storm32-BGC-32Bit-3Axis-Brushless-Gimbal-Controller-V1-31-DRV8313-Motor-Driver-l-/251865363574?epid=2171494658&hash=item3aa4587476:g:MBIAAOSweIlZZeQc\" >http://www.ebay.com/itm/Storm32-BGC-32Bit-3Axis-Brushless-Gimbal-Controller-V1-31-DRV8313-Motor-Driver-l-/251865363574?epid=2171494658&amp;hash=item3aa4587476:g:MBIAAOSweIlZZeQc</a>", "author": "enthropy92", "comment_id": "1520521", "author_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/dkrispis", "depth": "2", "parent": "1177690", "author_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/26/85/eb/2c/15/baboon-wallpaper-4_thumb_small.jpg", "date": "Sep 12, 2017 10:16 pm"}, {"text": "mount there? )", "author": "dkrispis", "comment_id": "1628632", "author_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/overbye", "depth": "3", "parent": "1520521", "author_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/6e/8e/a7/cf/77/707dae0f9ab3047972b9336a66ef6fac_thumb_small.jpg", "date": "Nov 28, 2017 10:09 am"}, {"text": "Is it possible to do this but for an iPhone?  thx a lot, David", "author": "stolt", "comment_id": "1165857", "author_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/stolt", "depth": "1", "parent": null, "author_img": "https://www.thingiverse.com/img/default/avatar/avatar_default_thumb_small.jpg", "date": "Jan 30, 2017 8:21 pm"}, {"text": "bonjours<br />\nmerci pour le partage<br />\npense tu que je peut monter cette nacelle sur mon phantom 1 ?<br />\ncordialement ", "author": "cyril81", "comment_id": "965408", "author_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/cyril81", "depth": "1", "parent": null, "author_img": "https://www.thingiverse.com/img/default/avatar/avatar_default_thumb_small.jpg", "date": "Aug 16, 2016 12:02 pm"}, {"text": "I have already printed the fragmaster's v1.5. will it fit there ?

part. This 5-shot barrel will replace the one on a Hammershot, just with some style. It is a simple design, since I'm still learning how to make features in OnShape.\nI have not printed this one, and my printers are broken (I cannibalized one to fix the other but failed, so I'm reassembling my first one.) So, if you print this part, please post your make and list my errors so my shame can be complete.\nBarrel1 is the barrel I have on my Hammershot now. It works great, but it does not hold onto the green ZombieStrike darts well. The old N-Strike series darts work fine. It also interferes with the air-restrictor, so don't dry-fire with this barrel.  Also, when finishing this barrel, I dry-fit all the parts before acetone-finishing and the parts fit great. After acetone finishing I needed to file open the two guide slots that fit the wings on the first piece for reassembly. You'll figure out what I mean as you reassemble, I'm sure. There must be an official name for all those parts but I'll just use &quot;Thing on that one thing.&quot;\nNOTE: For anyone who came here earlier and saw another barrel, I apologize. That one was not mine, and I had no part in making it. It was Andrew Schreiber's part found here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:140120\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:140120</a>\nI hadn't realized that I saved his file over mine some time ago.

Its powered by a cheap USB power bank (the ones that hold a single 18650 battery) that sits on top. \nYou will need 4x m3 bolts/nuts to secure the steppers and 10x dupoint cable to hook it all up.<br />\nThe Pi only has 2 5V pins, connect those to the motor drivers and either build a splitter or shove a male duopoint cable into the back of one of the female stepper motor ones (see picture).<br />\nYou'll want to put some tape (e.g. kapton, duct) between the drivers. \nYou'll also want to add a 1k resistor between the 5v echo pin of the ultrasonic module and the 3v3 GPIO on the Pi. To save soldering you can use another dupoint cable (see picture)\nTo attach the rear wheel you may be able to use some 3mm fillament or a 3mm metal pin like I have. A bit of heat from a heat gun helps the metal pin fit if its tight.\nSome python code I've used is here <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/topshed/ZeroBot\"
