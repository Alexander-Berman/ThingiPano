earliest methods of tracking time. These methods have seldom been used after the invention of the pendulum clock in the 16th century. With this timer, we make use of this exceedingly old concept and make it new again with 3D printing!  \nThis model makes use of only 3 printed parts and result in a fully functional water drop timer. As you could have guessed by the name, the timer (as well as its ancient counterpart) work by having a constant dripping of water from a reservoir. This water will then fall into a balanced arm with coins acting as counterweights, with a little time the arm will balance out; signifying the end of the timed period.   \nBy altering the amount and type of coins in the counterbalance, we can calibrate the timer for different amounts of time.   \nIn addition, mounting holes for a standard 5mm LED (or a piezo buzzer) have been included in the design. Using contacts on the bottom of the balancing arm and on the motion stop (the square-looking piece on the legs of the device, this stops the movement of the balance arm at 90 degrees), you can complete a circuit that will power the indicators.   \nContinue to the instruction tab to find out how to make your very own timer.  \nNOTE: The image you see of the Legs above is not what yours will look like, this was the result of poor 3D Print that broke after removal from the print bed. Yours will be complete and will have 2 additional mounting holes.  \n"}, {"header": "CountertopChallenge"}, {"header": "Instructions", "text": "----------------------Items Required----------------------  \n\n<li >13/32&quot; or 1mm drill bit (Optional, read on for clarification)  </li>\n<li >M3 Bolt x 10-30mm (Optional, read on for clarification)  </li>\n<li >Coins, multiple types and quantities  </li>\n\n----------------------Assembly/Construction----------------------  \nTo begin the construction of this device you will print out all of the pieces, here are a few things you should know...  \n\n<li >Print out the &quot;Balance_Arm_rev1&quot; and &quot;Main_Water_Tank_rev1&quot; with 100% infill, this will take longer than it would with only partial infill but it will ensure that there are no leaks   </li>\n<li >You can print these using either PLA or ABS, both of these plastics are not soluble in water  </li>\n\nIf you are not able to print the rather small &quot;Pin&quot; (as I was) you can use an M3 bolt in its place, any length will do (preferably longer than 10mm).  \nIf you find that the small hole at the bottom of the Main Water Bucket is not clear and/or perfectly round, use the 13/32 or 1mm drill bit to clear it out.  \nOnce you have printed all of the parts you can move on to assembly....  \n\n<li >Slide the Balance Arm onto the shaft protruding from the Legs of the timer, they should go on easily and have no friction when rotated  </li>\n<li >Insert the pin (or M3 bolt) into the hole on the shaft where the balancing arm lies, this will ensure that the arm does not slide off  </li>\n<li >Slide the Main Water Bucket onto the top of the legs, they should also go on smoothly without any interference  </li>\n\nOptionally, you can use the 4 mounting holes made available on the platform of Legs to bolt the device onto a larger piece of wood, plastic, etc. However, if have found that this was not necessary, even with a fully filled Main Water Tank.  \nAt this point, if you chose so, you can attach the LED or piezo buzzer onto the included mount (the small right-most platform extended from the legs).  \n----------------------Usage----------------------   \nTo use your Water Drop Timer, follow the below instructions....  \n\n<li >Place the type and quantity of coins required for your timing duration on the small bucket on the Balance Arm (refer to table below)  </li>\n<li >Fill the Main Water Bucket with water, plugging the hole at the bottom  </li>\n<li >Unplug the hole on the Main Water Tank when you are ready to begin the timing duration  </li>\n<li >Wait until the Balancing Arm levels out, at which point your timing duration is complete  </li>\n\nTo know how many and which coins must be used to get different timing duration's, refer to the table below....  \nNOTE: The table makes an approximation between Canadian and American currency weights, the difference should not affect your outcomes too adversely.  \n2 Quarters: 25 seconds<br />\n4 Quarters: 50 seconds<br />\n6 Quarters: 1 minute 15 seconds<br />\nLoonie (Canada only): 10 seconds<br />\nToonie (Canada only): 12 seconds<br />\n4 Nickles: 45 seconds<br />\n6 Nickles: 1 minute 10 seconds<br />\n8 Nickles: 2 minutes<br />\n4 Penny/Dime: 5 seconds  \nYou can use combinations of these coin combinations to reach a custom time period, although they may not be as accurate.  \n----------------------Calibration (Optional)----------------------  \nIf you calibrate the timer yourself, you will be likely get a more accurate reading from the timer. Since the more scientific method of using the timer this will take too long to calculate each time, we simply measure the approximate timings. Follow the below instructions....  \n\n<li >Gather the different combinations of coins (or more) that are listed in the above Usage area  </li>\n<li >Place the each combination of coins in the smaller bucket on the Balance Arm (one combination at a time)  </li>\n<li >Plugging the hole at the bottom of the Main Water Bucket, fill the bucket with water  </li>\n<li >Unblocking the hole, start a different timer and wait until the Balance arm levels out  </li>\n<li >Record the amount of time this took  </li>\n\nRepeat the above process for each of the combinations of coins, recording each. In the end you will have a precisely calibrated list of different coin combinations and their respective times.   \n"}], "tags": [["ancient", "tag:Ancient"], ["clock", "tag:clock"],

Use a tool like a screwdriver to make sure it fits tight. Use a blade of a cutter to shorten it. Then measure needed belt length on one of either side of the belt and insert into the tool appropriately. This means, if you are measuring on the longer side (top of the belt tip) insert the belt in such a way, that the exact length is reached at the top tip side.  \n<strong >Do not change direction!</strong><br />\nIf you inserted the belt from the right, forward to the left and measure accordingly.  \nRemove the remaining belt from the tool and move the belt end in the tool some millimeters to the left or right, just that the end is not atop of the cutting line and fix it in the tool again. Apply superglue or cyanoacrylate to the first cut surface, making sure no glue comes to the toothed side, and insert it accordingly into the tool. Use  a screwdriver or something similar to fix it and &quot;rub&quot; the belt towards the other end, so that some pressure is applied on the cut area. Apply some glue to the backside, so that it could soak into openings between the two belts.  \nWait for the adhesive to dry and remove the ready belt.  \n<strong >Be careful with the amount of glue!</strong><br />\nCyanoacrylate reacts with PLA and you do not want to fix your belt with the tool.

experimental component that is under development to be part of a prosthesis and is currently being tested for upper limb prostheses.  It is heat formed from a 3D printed part.  By heat forming it, a simple dimensional sized 3D printed shape creates a socket that is customized to fit the user.  During the thermoforming, there is cross bonding of the linearly extruded PLA as it is further annealed to create a much stronger bond between layers of the printed part.  \nThis socket uses a 1/2 inch - 20 thread flange locknut. This nut will allow the socket to be screwed onto a conventional prosthetic terminal device.  \nThe nut in the pictures can be obtained from McMaster Carr.... <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.mcmaster.com/#94831a671/=wbk3jh\" >http://www.mcmaster.com/#94831a671/=wbk3jh</a>   \nIn the included pictures, this socket is formed over a plaster mold of an amputee's residual limb. The socket design also lends itself to molding over other cast or printed models of the residual limb.  \nThis socket is designed for a trans-radial amputee and was trimmed and buffed with a Dremel to allow for freedom of elbow motion of the residual limb.  \nBelow is a link to a video of a Monette Socket being heat formed...<br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n0LvtSFq18&feature=youtu.be\" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n0LvtSFq18&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>   \nThis device was co-designed with Skip Meetze.  \nSpecial thanks to the RIT e-NABLE team and other volunteers in the www.enablingthefuture.org community.  \nThanks to Harrision Ham and Joe Hoppes and staff, Advanced Orthopedics and Prosthetics in Newport Richey, FL for addition designs of the Monette socket.\n"}], "tags": [["3dprinting", "tag:3dprinting"], ["enable", "tag:enable"], ["prosthetic", "tag:prosthetic"], ["Prosthetic_hand", "tag:Prosthetic_hand"]], "published_datetime": "2015-03-15 15:22:57 GMT", "banner_challenge_winner": false, "images": ["https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/ae/17/86/ef/26/20150408_173033_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/8d/cf/1b/7a/c1/cone_ss_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/38/c2/b1/3c/e9/cone_s_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/24/00/d7/94/11/IMG_20150315_161239_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/7c/7e/e5/a2/08/IMG_20150315_161132_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/44/00/b7/b6/51/jeffs_cone_10_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/62/87/16/d5/48/IMG_20150312_100951357_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/5a/64/64/02/d0/IMG_20150312_100946510_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/11/ef/39/fb/05/IMG_20150315_093812264_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/63/3e/1a/47/77/IMG_20150315_093934631_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/ef/54/aa/f8/05/IMG_20150312_101020866_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/bd/58/32/e2/09/IMG_20150315_094222_preview_featured.jpg"], "remixes_number": "0", "author_url_img": "https://www.thingiverse.com/img/default/avatar/avatar_professional_thumb_small.jpg", "comments": [{"text": "Hey Jeff I am trying to catch up with you guys on the e-nable arm effort.

Shorter lengths = more rigid.  This is built using hardware store emt conduit (In the US it is sold as 3/4&quot; (ID)), or as an upgrade you can use stainless steel tubing.\nMost woods and plastics should be no problem. I milled Aluminum with a footprint of 23.5in x 32in x 4in.  Aluminum works well <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMuYgX0rY\" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIYMuYgX0rY</a>\nYou can switch the spindle out with a drag knife, laser, Extruder, ect, making it a great prototyping multi-tool. By adding length and depth It could easily be used to shape large easily milled things like wood, foam, or plastics. Keep it small for aluminum.   \n"}, {"header": "Add Ons", "text": "End Stop Mount<br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1023985\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1023985</a>  \nMK8 MK9 extruder mount 3D printer<br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:868983\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:868983</a>  \nDewalt DW660 Mount<br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:944952\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:944952</a><br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://amzn.to/1D7xByM\" >http://amzn.to/1D7xByM</a>  \nDW660 perpendicularity tester<br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1525661\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1525661</a><br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://youtu.be/WM2AMtxMhMk\" >https://youtu.be/WM2AMtxMhMk</a>  \nPen Mount<br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1612207\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1612207</a>  \nBlank Tool Mounts<br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:805803\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:805803</a>\nLaser (Leo69) Mount<br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1636811\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1636811</a>\nIf what you are looking for isn't here search &quot;MPCNC 525&quot;\n"}, {"header": "Print Settings", "text": "<strong >Rafts: </strong>\n                     <p >Doesn't Matter</p>\n<strong >Supports: </strong>\n                     <p >No</p>\n<strong >Infill: </strong>\n                     <p >See <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.vicious1.com/blog/parts/\" >http://www.vicious1.com/blog/parts/</a></p>\n"}, {"header": "Instructions", "text": "Wood Demo<br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://youtu.be/j_O9fbzjSn8\" >https://youtu.be/j_O9fbzjSn8</a>  \n3D Printing<br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://youtu.be/amo8czFC75Y\" >https://youtu.be/amo8czFC75Y</a>  \nDual head<br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://youtu.be/TZso__iMGu8\" >https://youtu.be/TZso__iMGu8</a>  \n4 Head Madness!

I am importing my svg file into Estlcam from Inkscape and creating toolpaths using the engrave tool, my settings are set up like those on Allted's site as well. I save the CNC Program and put it into my machine via SD (using Full LCD only, no Repetier, Pronterface, etc) Before I start the machine I set it to where I want the origin to be (X, Y, and Z) then turn the machine on I goto Print from SD and here is where the fun begins.... The toolhead moves approx 6 inches in X and 6 in Y away from my origin and then starts the carve/engrave. The Z is a little funky to, but Im not sure its the same type of issue (somehting tells me its tool settings or something). Also the engraving/carve is backwards on the workpiece, I found a way to get around this by flipping the drawing in Estlcam, but I would prefer to not have to do this if possible.

I'm primarely a woodworker, but i love creating things.  So primarily looking to do routing work in dense hardwoods. But i also have a need to do some aluminum milling.  I'd probably build something ~30\"x48\" to start.  But i'm wondering how accurate &amp; rigid is ur current setup for milling stuff like aluminum at those sizes?  And would the new 25.4mm(1\") version u are working on provide a marked improvement over the 3/4\" version for rigidity?  I would even consider going stainless at some point but probably not for the 1st version given the added cost as i need to learn on it.<br />\nThanks<br />\nAnd curious to hear what those who have built are achieving w/ a mostly stock built unit.

The USB cable you supplied with your kit seems to be faulty. I used it with one of my laptops using the CNC, which worked great, and every time I plugged in the usb cable my touchpad would stop working so I had to unplug it every time I wanted to move my mouse, and I really didn't think anything bad at the time. About a week later after doing several different jobs on my CNC my computer wouldn't recognize an arduino anymore, none of my arduinos worked with the computer and the computer was using the neccessary driver files. After the next few weeks I used the same cable to program my other arduinos and the arduinos didn't do what my programs specified, so I looked over the program several times and couldn't find an error. I even did a simple program like digitalwrite one port HIGH and wait 2 seconds and turn it off and wait 10 seconds. It seems that the HIGH/LOW is swapped that it turns on a digital port when it is in LOW and turns it off when it is HIGH. I thought that it was the computer I was using so I did the same thing on another computer with a different arduino that didnt have that problem and it did the SAME thing. I even tried a different usb cable and it did the same thing. I then realized that it had to be the USB cable ruining my arduinos and my computers usb ports since it wont even recognize a usb flashdrive anymore. I had 5 working arduinos and it ruined 4. They still work if I use HIGH for off and LOW for on but do this weird sequence first when the arduino starts up randomly changing the values of the digital ports every second for about 5 seconds and then it stops. I ruined one of my arduino nanos by plugging it in to the computer that had the faulty usb ports(big mistake) then I realized that it didn't work anymore. I am wondering if one of the 5 volt wires are touching the data cable sending 5 volts to my arduino and sending 5 volts to the computer(which has a protection against that but after a few hours of the cable being connected to the computer it ruined it, knowing that the protection can only protect it for so long until it's dead. I am not 100% positive this is the issue, It could just be an compatiblility issue between the computer and the arduino, but I dont think this is true because I used a different arduino and a different computer and the same cable and it had the same exact problem.

I put power in the voltage input pin on the arduino while having it connected to my computer so 2 different power being put into the board ruined it (it started smoking around the usb connector on the arduino). I noticed that you have the power supply powering the arduino board and it is required to plug in the usb cable to your computer so additional power is being put on the board. Maybe seperating the power of the ramps board and the arduino or just putting cables in the kits that have the ground and the data wire without the +5v wire. I could be wrong, the arduino may be able to support voltage input and usb input at the same time but I am just telling from my own experience. I did use a voltage meter on the cable and found that 2 of the conductors had high resistance to eachother telling me that 2 of the conductors are in partial contact. I also did the same thing to a cable that worked and it didnt have any reading at all telling me that the cable is truely defective. I believe that the cable was either defective when I got it or was fine when I got it and through hours of use with 2 different ways of powering the arduino board were on it could have partially melted the conductors in the usb cable and caused a connection.

You probably did no ruined the whole arduino, just the 5V regulator on the Arduino board (this is a very common issue). On my prusa I just disconnected the diode on the Ramps board that supplies the input voltage to the Arduino 5V regulator and powered the Arduino with an External 5V supply (via spliced USB cable). Some people did creative soldering of a more capable 5V regulator on the Arduino board. Also, if the resettable 5V fuse on the Arduino board is shorted at any point in time it may never recover to a low resistance state (hence underpowering the Arduino). Good news is, if you separate the 5V supply as I describe above you can resuscitate  the \"ruined\" boards (i.e. if the problem was just the regulator of fuse).

Even for the people using NEMA 17 this would double the X,Y torque back to its rated levels per motor.  Also the motors would each be directly wired into the board which would be slightly simpler.

Of course the whole device would gain a lot of weight, but that additional pressure would only be on the legs, and not on any moving parts.

How would you go about ensuring a proper realignment?

Instead I split it up into roughly 30 individual 2D panels then cut it all out of MDF, then glued it all together. If you'd like these panels, just leave a comment or something and I'll send them.<br />\nI then made the flaps, cutout and speed brake out of aluminium bar, and just bent it. For flaps, also made a small box with a spring making it need to be pulled up for it to be moveable. It doesn't look great but then nobody will ever see it. There's a picture above.  \nThrottle were 3 flat panels of  6mm MDF, the centre hollowed and microswitches installed (for reversers.) The actual handle bit I turned on a lathe but it would be much better printing it.  \nIf you plan to make this, you'll need a few things:<br />\n\u2022 roughly 5 microswitches (reversers and park brake)<br />\n\u2022 6 potentiometers (levers)<br />\n\u2022 1 red LED (park brake)<br />\n\u2022 2 toggle switches (Stab trim)<br />\n\u2022 bolts + screws<br />\n\u2022 5 push buttons (TOGA, AT off, horn cutout)<br />\n\u2022 a spring (for flaps. ideally there would also be springs on speed brake lever, cutout levers and the reversers.  \nIf you aren't going to print much and are doing most of it by hand like me, you'll need<br />\n\u2022 drill (cordless is best)<br />\n\u2022 bolts/nuts/screws + screwdrivers/spanners/pliers etc<br />\n\u2022 lots of MDF of varying widths<br />\n\u2022 lots of PVA glue<br />\n\u2022 a jigsaw or bandsaw to cut out the panels (bandsaw's best)<br />\n\u2022 a sander to get them all accurate (electric!)<br />\n\u2022 polyfilla to make it all nice and smooth<br />\n\u2022 aluminium bar<br />\n\u2022 araldite or other really strong glue (for the aluminium bar)<br />\n\u2022 a router's can be useful, otherwise a wood file should do the job<br />\n\u2022 a hacksaw for cutting bolts, etc<br />\n\u2022 and a 3D printer for when you decide that you can't be bothered. It does take a while.  \nAnd to make it much, much easier for you, don't glue it all together until the handles and levers are in.  \nI've got more detail at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cockpitonabudget.wordpress.com\" >http://cockpitonabudget.wordpress.com</a>.

(yey!).\nThis simplified little combination lock is just a bit taller then one centimeter and could probably be made even smaller. \nIt actually worked on the first print, just had to reprint for some cosmetics reasonst and longer lock bars to lessen the play.\nThis one opens with A / E and has a few letters on each ring.\nExcuse the bad pictures, I had to use the flash and then harsh gamma correction so the details show- resulting in an odd look.\nIMPORTAINT!<br />\nPrinted on a pp3dp up + on 0.2mm/fine; You will need angled tweezers to clean out some of the support, but it was easier then I thought.\nThe bars on the innter tubus are just a bit too long, you may want to sand them, clip them, cut them etc.<br />\nCHANGES:<br />\nOn the new version I alreaddy made them 0.3mm shorter-

marker  to indicate where you have to turn the letters to.<br />\n-A bit bigger hole to store secret messages in the tube<br />\n-inner tubus lock-bars are a tad too long (can be sanded/cut, but on the new version I alreaddy made them 0.3mm shorter- but not thiner)<br />\n-Also helps to make them a little thinner<br />\n-The inner &quot;rails&quot; are unneccesary, but won't hurt anything.<br
