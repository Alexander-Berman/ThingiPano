Walker Endowment, 1990.22  \nAfrican Art and Indian Art of the Americas<br />\nGallery 136  \nThe lords of Maya city-states in southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras portrayed themselves on stone monuments called stelae.

The subject\u2019s gaunt face suggests that he is elderly. He holds a double-headed serpent bar across his body and is dressed in ceremonial attire associated with the Maize God, consisting of a plumed headdress, jade jewelry, a jade-netted kilt, and a spondylus seashell below the midriff. This costume symbolically connected the ruler to the earth, sky, water, and maize (corn).<br />\nHieroglyphics carved on the left side of the monument record the date 9.13.10.0.0 in the Maya calendar, corresponding to January 26, A.D. 702, which marked the completion of a Maya 10-year period. The text on the right side documents the ritual auto-sacrificial bloodletting performed by the ruler to commemorate this significant moment in time. Although they are too highly eroded to read accurately, the hieroglyphs on the front of the stela likely name the ruler, his ancestry, and the place where he governed  \n<a rel=\"nofollow\"

And if the thing you're trying to secure is a bundle of pipes, the hooks really get in the way because they don't bend well around the bundle.<br />\nThis clip will secure any size item (provide the bungie cord is longer than it's circumference) because it's adjustable. More importantly, it's small so it will fit better on a small item.\nThe clip is fully functional right now but it could be less clunkly looking, more slim and it might help if the teeth are angled a bit. I may make some of those changes but I'm going to provide the scad file so others can do it if they like. \n"}, {"header": "Instructions", "text": "The Bungie Clip is straight forward to print. It's actually kind of oversized (thicker than it needs to be) because there will be stresses on it as the bungie cord tightens and I wanted it to be strong. \nTo use it, get a piece of bungie cord. Stick one end through the hole at the end of the clip and tie it off (or fold it over and staple it if you want to be all professional about it). \nWrap the other end around the thing to be secured. Then push it through the hole in the middle, pull it as tight as you need it, and then pull it through the groove with the teeth on the end. Because you're stretching it, it will go between the teeth and then, when you let go, it will expand and get stuck. That's it, your item is secure.\nTo remove, pull the loose end until it stretches and then pull it out of the teeth and let it slide back through the middle hole. \n"}], "tags": [["openscad",

"Here is just about all the parts you need to build your own Kossel Mini. Included are frame pieces, end stop brackets, carriages, effector, and some accessories I think are needed like fan brackets and shroud. Some of the items tell you how many to print i,e. 1x 3x in the file name. All non essential items have optional in the name so you don't go and print a lot of stuff you may not want.  \nThe frame is made of 15mm x 15mm (1515) extruded aluminum from Open Beam or Mitsumi <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/110300465870/?KWSearch=HFS3-1515&catalogType=00000034877\" >http://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/110300465870/?KWSearch=HFS3-1515&amp;catalogType=00000034877</a>  \nI have many blog posts and videos detailing the Kossel Mini build process  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.electronhacks.com/category/electronics/3dprinting/\" >http://www.electronhacks.com/category/electronics/3dprinting/</a>  \nView the thing instructions by clicking the tab above for more info...\n"}, {"header": "Instructions", "text": "The core Kossel Mini filees are fairly stable but If you want access to the original .stl files from Johann he has them up on GitHub <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/jcrocholl/kossel\" >https://github.com/jcrocholl/kossel</a>  \nI have some other Kossel accessories you should consider like the Filament Spool Holder <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:259003\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:259003</a> and RAMPS board enclosure <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:258797\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:258797</a>  \nYou can use just about any extruder, in my opinion if using a direct drive extruder like the one included or Airtripper's <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:22426\" >http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:22426</a> you will need a gear reduced stepper motor to get enough torque.
