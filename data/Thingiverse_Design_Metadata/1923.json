"Summary", "text": "Print your very own Martian habitat!  \nHI-SEAS (Hawai\u2019i Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) is a long duration analog Mars mission. HI-SEAS.org. I'm a crew member of mission III which began October 15, 2014 and will end June 13, 2015  \nThe main purpose of the mission is to help understand how crew members interact when living and working together during long duration, isolated missions (like a mission to Mars) as well as how to select crew members for such missions. As such we have no live contact with the outside world, we eat shelf stable food and wear simulated space suits whenever we leave the habitat.  \nIn addition to the main study there are a number of opportunistic studies going on as well. They are focused on either psychology, group dynamics or some combination of the two. Generally they involve some kind of task or game and filling out surveys about our mood and interactions with other crew members. In total there are about 40 tasks per week for these six studies.   \nOn top of those, we all have our own individual research areas as well. I\u2019m looking at the utility of 3D printing in Mars missions/in isolated environments. For more info see my blog at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.almostmars.com\" >https://www.almostmars.com</a><br />\nOther people\u2019s research areas and blogs are:<br />\nMartha \u2013 indoor gardening - <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://martianadventures.wordpress.com/\" >https://martianadventures.wordpress.com/</a><br />\nJocelyn \u2013 looking at cortisol/stress levels and correlating it exercise, sleep, eating habits, etc. -<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fivestarview.blogspot.com/\" >http://fivestarview.blogspot.com/</a><br />\nSophie \u2013 Robotics - <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://domesoph.wordpress.com/\" >https://domesoph.wordpress.com/</a><br />\nNeil \u2013 gut/skin microbiome<br />\nAllen \u2013 looking at Earth-Mars transfer orbits  \nAbout the Habitat:<br />\nThe HI-SEAS Habitat is located at approximately 8000 ft elevation on the northern slope of Mauna Loa. The habitat, based on a dome supplied by Pacific Domes International with internal two-story structure designed by V. Paul Ponthieux of Envision Design, was built by the Blue Planet Foundation of Honolulu, Hawaii. The geodesic dome is 36 feet in diameter, enclosing a volume of 13,570 cubic feet. The ground floor has an area of 993 square feet (878 square feet usable) and includes common areas such as kitchen, dining, bathroom with shower, lab, exercise, and common spaces. The second floor loft spans an area of 424 square feet and includes six separate staterooms and a half bath. In addition, a 160 square foot workshop converted from a 20-foot high steel shipping container is attached to the habitat.\n"}, {"header": "Instructions", "text": "I've been printing at a 1:200 scale but scale as you see fit.  \nI've been printing default setting on my Up Mini, .25mm layers.

This is a great system with one flaw. Once the bottles have been opened they are not very secure. I have had one fall over and leak all over my drawer. So I made this.  \nInitially I just made the base and it holds the bottles so securely that it's all you really need.

currently, I encourage you to visit my website and leave comments there! &lt;3 :) ]\nFinally this project is done!<br />\nI call it &quot;Surprise Box&quot;. The Box I created has several layers.<br />\nThe lower layer is used to hide Arduino and battery. I also make a hold at the bottom of the heart, in order for a LED light to go in.<br />\nThe Arduino part of my project, I used a PIR sensor, so when people approach the box or when people open it, the heart will be light up.  \nAnother thing is the &quot;fence&quot; that's built inside the box by a wall of hexagons, which created an empty space inside, was supposed to be used for planting. My original idea was to plant some moss in the box as a background. However, I haven't found moss to plant there yet, so I used some dry pine tree leaves instead.  \n<strong ><em >Meaning </em></strong><br />\nThe meaning behind my &quot;Surprise Box&quot; project, except from making whoever receives the box surprised/happy, also symbolizes my view of protecting the environment:<br />\nDuring my environmental volunteering trip this semester, I was surprised by how ignorant people could be and don't think that our action can actually have influence on the environment.<br />\nAnd the plant/ moss part of the project conveys my idea that personally, I think plants have &quot;hearts&quot;, or their feelings too. So when people cut a tree, it can feel the pain. The flowers on the heart and the butterfly symbolize the beauty and purity of the nature. The nature provides all these enjoyable sceneries to all the livings in this world, and they are something that we human need to treasure and protect. \n"}, {"header": "Instructions", "text": "I used SLS to print it.

Clone, no.<br />\nThis is just a tribute.  \nThis project began as a fun way to learn AutoDesk Fusion 360. I started by importing the entire Solidworks CAD file into a new Fusion 360 project, dropped the frame (walls) from the printer, built 20x20 Misumi aluminum extrusions to wrap the printer guts and then worked to build brackets to support all the parts that previously attached to the frame.  \nI've been printing nonstop on this new printer with the same precision and quality as my real UM2. In fact, I can use the same GCODE in either machine with identical results.   \n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://myhub.autodesk360.com/ue29daf71/shares/public/SHabee1QT1a327cf2b7a3740d73d0935e0d3\" >A360 Source Download Link</a> - Use this link to download a copy of the source (in your CAD flavor). \n"}, {"header": "Buying Parts", "text": "<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oL7RYvvKJJkxDS52M6GQemwey3ny0b3jYZnxLergKKQ/edit?usp=sharing\" >The BOM - Click here</a>\nThe prices in the BOM are most likely out of date. Use the links in the BOM to find the parts. I had good experiences with all of the sellers I dealt with and found the parts to be close-to if not identical to official parts. This includes the 1.75mm version of the UM2 nozzle/heatblock.  \nThe BOM has a breakdown to buy all the parts to build the Z-axis platform/heated bed <em >or</em> to buy the official UM2 heated bed kit (which is actually intended for the UMO+). The cost of getting the kit is only $15 more when you calculate the PSU and lead screw Z-axis motor. There's also a small electronics board which acts as a relay for powering the heaterboard with the 24PSU and outputing 19V for the UMO. It's not needed, but an added bonus for a future project. :-) The kit is going to be easier... but it depends on how patient and adventurous you are.  \n"}, {"header": "Build Instructions", "text": "<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iZN1Qa6s9Yto3foaHEdEPrx-5QusVKVUGyTJ6U6o7BY/edit?usp=sharing\" >Build Instructions - Click Here</a>\nPlease refer to the official Ultimaker 2 assembly instructions for assembling the gantry and print head.\n"}, {"header": "Floor of the Printer", "text": "My printer is using 1/4&quot; acrylic that I bought from Lowes and cut on a 20x12 laser cutter.

have attached three different versions for an Iphone, Ipod Touch and an Android which vary according to where the camera lens is located.  These were made to fit on a Bausch and Lomb stereo microscope.<br />\nWhile these are technically not a new design, I wanted to share my results and thoughts with anyone who is working on an adapter, and I know there are many.<br />\nMicroscopes vary from one another, so the first adaptation you need is the diameter of the eyepiece.<br />\nSecond, depending on the make and model of the scope, you need to determine the optimum distance between the camera and the eyepiece. I did this by simply holding the camera steady and measuring with a ruler the approximate distance that gave me a good clear image without the tunnel effect. This distance was the offset that I used on the adapter. Regardless of what you use for a camera, this distance won't change.<br />\nUsing a diffuser filter (pictured) eliminated a halo effect from the light source that I was experiencing.<br />\nI don't have the capability of producing a parametric model, but if anyone has the time I think this would make a great addition to the open source lab tools. Every student has at least one of these camera devices, they can be printed very quickly and as you can see a pair of rubber bands is all that is needed to secure the camera.<br />\nCheers\n"}],

Cut in a small gap and put the 2D figures together to create a 3-dimensional puppet. \n"}, {"header": "Instructions", "text": "Converting the Drawer into a Theater:  \n\n<li >Disassemble an old wooden drawer. Pull out the base plate. Saw a part of. The part should be at least 15 cm wide - big enough to reach through the gap in the base plate. Then put the cropped base plate back into the drawer.  </li>\n<li >Screw four small eye bolts into the inside of the drawer. One eye bolt into each corner.  </li>\n<li >Measure your drawer and saw two wooden boards. These boards partition the drawer into three segments: I) Gap in the base plate for playing, II) Compartement for storing puppets and scenery, III) Compartement for tucking in the scenery. Attach the boards to the drawer with adhesive tape, nails or screws.   </li>\n<li >Cut two pieces of rope, e.g. nylon thread, that have the same lenght (about 1m). Tie the nylon threads to the eye bolts. Now you can suspend the theater everywhere you like.  </li>\n\nCutting the Puppets and the Scenery:  \n\n<li >Measure the compartements of your drawer. The size of your Storage Compartement defines the maximum size of the puppets. The scenery can be cut in halfs or thirds in order to fit into the compartement.  </li>\n<li >Open the inkscape-file. Define the size of the figures as desired. Set a proper document size that corresponds to your laser cutter, too. Sometimes you have to rotate the figure 90\u00b0 in order to fit onto your board. Set the proper stroke width (black, 0.01 mm).<br />\nTIP: I made the figures out of cardboard, but I would recommend to use wood and to integrate the gap for sticking together the two figures into the inkscape-model. The gap has to be as wide as your wood is thick.   </li>\n<li >Let the laser cutter cut out the figures. Cut the scenery in half if it's too big. Joint it together simply via tape or with another kind of hinge-joint, so it can be folded together.   </li>\n\nStick the puppets together and tuck in the scenery. Have fun playing &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;.  \n"}], "tags": [["Children", "tag:Children"], ["diy", "tag:diy"], ["drawer", "tag:drawer"], ["fairy_tale", "tag:fairy_tale"], ["kids", "tag:kids"], ["laser", "tag:laser"], ["lasercut", "tag:lasercut"], ["laser_cutter", "tag:laser_cutter"], ["play", "tag:play"], ["puppet", "tag:puppet"], ["School", "tag:School"], ["theater", "tag:theater"], ["theatre", "tag:theatre"], ["toy", "tag:toy"], ["wood", "tag:wood"]], "published_datetime": "2015-05-06 15:19:08 GMT", "banner_challenge_winner": false, "images": ["https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/47/4d/07/f1/aa/path3168_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/c0/0c/36/c9/39/Puppentheater_preview_featured.jpg", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/a8/fe/85/34/cf/DSC01311-2_preview_featured.JPG", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/95/5d/26/65/b5/DSC01268_preview_featured.JPG", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/bc/9b/27/23/1f/DSC09337_preview_featured.JPG", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/bc/0e/6a/a5/73/DSC09258_preview_featured.JPG", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/f2/75/10/e6/2a/DSC09249_preview_featured.JPG", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/d3/b0/81/64/00/DSC01255_preview_featured.JPG", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/1e/5c/c2/76/4e/DSC01254_preview_featured.JPG", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/57/c3/67/a0/65/DSC01317_preview_featured.JPG", "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/08/c6/b0/bb/9b/DSC01315_preview_featured.JPG"], "remixes_number": "0", "author_url_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/89/2c/d3/85/2f/IMAG0068_thumb_small.jpg", "comments": [], "liked_by": [{"user_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/dd/57/30/d4/ef/4ff0e520128c591ba54ac57e2f9b8e3e_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/42robots", "user": "42robots"}, {"user_img": "https://www.thingiverse.com/img/default/avatar/avatar_default_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/EliSenter", "user": "EliSenter"}, {"user_img": "https://www.thingiverse.com/img/default/avatar/avatar_default_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/BrodyTTU", "user": "BrodyTTU"}, {"user_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/43/97/67/35/a1/OfficeSpace_111Pyxurz_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/perlguy99", "user": "perlguy99"}, {"user_img": "https://www.thingiverse.com/img/default/avatar/avatar_default_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/lestarch", "user": "lestarch"}, {"user_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/df/6f/59/cb/09/gravatar_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/mose", "user": "mose"}, {"user_img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/76/f3/61/b9/81/sonic_display_large_thumb_small.jpg", "user_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/joo", "user": "joo"}], "id": "811524", "made_number": "0", "category": "/toys-and-games/playsets", "banner_verified": false, "author": "JudithNina", "author_url": "https://www.thingiverse.com/JudithNina", "likes": "7", "collection_number": "5"}, {"print_settings": {}, "banner_featured": false, "remixed_from": [], "notice_violation": false, "banner_education": false, "files": [{"updated_timestamp": "05-06-15", "file_id": "1294826", "thing_id": "811526", "download_link": "https://www.thingiverse.com/download:1294826", "img": "https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/ff/66/55/cc/e6/v3legs_preview_tinycard.jpg", "filename": "v3legs.stl", "file_name": "v3legs.stl", "size": "730kb", "downloads": "119"}], "customizer": false, "watches": "0", "makes": [], "title": "DJI F550/F450 leg extender", "notice_moderation": false, "downloads": "118", "notice_wip": false, "views": "619", "license": "Creative Commons -

"description": [{"header": "Summary", "text": "Last week I went to the car wash but forgot to take of my radio antenna. so it broke down.  \nThe socked for the antenna was M5 thread so I thought lets try making my own antenna.  \nI bought a meter of M5 threaded rod and divided it in 4 pieces, (so I had some spare-parts for when it happens again)  \nwhen I connected it to the socked my radio worked great again, it only looked crap. so i thought lets make something i can screw over the M5-rod.  \nnext thing i did: I made a pipe(inner diameter 4.6mm outer diameter 5.4mm in solidworks and tryed experimenting with slic3rs spiral vase settings, after some experimenting I finally found the right settings to make the female M5 thread to fit over my rod.  \nSettings I used:  \nNozzle size: 0.8 (mine is just 0.4 but otherwise I cant make a layer thickness of 0.75)<br />\nLayer thickness : 0.75<br />\nspeed: very low (7mm/s)<br />\nperimeters: 1<br />\nfan speed: a constant 70%  \nmaterial settings:<br />\nfilament diameter: 1.75<br />\nthen I set the extrusion multiplier on 2.21 because i needed atleast dubbel the amount of material because of the layer thinkness and width i wanted.  \nafter that i needed to scale the object so it would fit my M5 threaded rod, so in the end I scaled the object to 144% normal size.<br />\nresult&gt; &quot;Female&quot; M5 threaded-rod<br />\nI also tryed printing the &quot;male M5 threaded-rod by scaling my pipe down to 61% and worked great aswell.  \nHope this is Usefull to someone ^^\n"}], "tags": [["3D", "tag:3D"], ["3d_printer",

It was designed by the firm of noted architect I. M. Pei(Chinese: \u8c9d\u807f\u9298), who was also responsible for the master plan and the early development of the campus of Tunghai University, with likely participation by architects Chi-kuan Chen(Chinese: \u9673\u5176\u5bec) and Chao-kang Chang(Chinese: \u5f35\u8087\u5eb7). The chapel was named in honor of the Rev. Henry W. Luce, an American missionary in China in the late 19th century and father of publisher Henry R. Luce.  \nThe project was originally planned in April 1954 but put on hold until July 1960. Construction took place from September 1962 until November 1963. Construction costs totaled 125,000 USD.[1]  \nThe chapel is located on a 3-acre zone in the center of campus, and is set on an irregular hexagonal base, providing 477 m\u00b2 of gross floor area, including the 245 m\u00b2 nave (with 500 seats), 81 m\u00b2 chancel, and 44 m\u00b2 robing rooms. The church itself is a tent-like conoid structure, with four warped leaves rising to 19.2 m high, establishing itself as a central landmark on campus.  \nThe chapel was first conceived as a multi-planar, wooden structure, but the architects soon abandoned the idea of using wood due both to the humid environment and to seismic concerns. The form of four curved surfaces built with reinforced concrete was likely influenced by the design of the Philips Pavilion, designed by renown architect Le Corbusier for the Brussels World\u2019s Fair (known as Expo 58) in 1958. However, unlike the Philips Pavilion and other contemporary ruled-surface buildings of the era, Luce Chapel is not a thin-shell structure. The chapel\u2019s planes are composed of lattice beams that gradually grow thicker as they descend. The structural concept might be influenced by that of the Yale University Art Gallery, completed in 1953 and designed by Louis Kahn, another noted architect of the time. The exterior of the Chapel is covered with yellow, glazed, diamond-shaped tiles echoing the diamond-shaped coffer beams on the building\u2019s interior. The Chapel\u2019s elaborate reinforced concrete formwork was created by local craftsmen.  \n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luce_Memorial_Chapel\"

If printed separately, the legs are<br />\nin two halves that glue together and then glue to the arm (this<br />\narrangement is stronger than the leg &amp; arm printed together).<br />\nI printed with ABS and use acetone to glue together.  \nTo complete the frame you will need 6 anti-vibration balls (strong<br />\nenough to hold the battery weight between them), 8 40mm M3 bolts,<br />\n12 12mm M3 bolts and associated nylock nuts &amp; washers, and 16<br />\n10mm M3 bolts for the motor mounts.  \nObviously all the usual quad parts are needed to complete the<br />\nmodel - motors, props, ESCs, controller, power distribution board,<br />\nR/C receiver and battery, and optional camera, FPV transmitter,<br />\nGPS etc.  \nThe design as given is to fit a MultiWii PRO flight controller, but<br />\nother controllers can be accommodated by changing the OpenScad<br />\nparameters.  If you want to tweak the design, there are plenty of<br />\ncomments in the OpenScad file to guide you.  It is particularly easy<br />\nto change the motor mounting hole positions to suit different<br />\nmotors.  There seems to be no standard as to where the wires come out of the motors - you can change the orientation to get the wires to<br />\ncome out along the arm.  The controller lid is optional, and is used<br />\nto shield the barosensor on the controller from air currents and<br />\nlight.  \nArms are an OpenScad derivative of the arms in the

kaleidocycle using six pseudo-tetrahedra. The hinges are &quot;snap joints&quot;.  \nSee the video: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://youtu.be/Qxe9ZNujcss\" >http://youtu.be/Qxe9ZNujcss</a>\n"}, {"header": "Instructions", "text": "PRINT:<br />\n(3) &quot;A&quot;<br />\n(3) &quot;B&quot;  \nThe arrows must be pointing UP when orientating for slicing.  These are not symmetrical.  Connect &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot;.  Designed to print without support structures.  \nI sliced at 0.1 mm layer height, 4 mm wall, 100% fill.  The actual wall thickness of the object is 1.2 mm.  Printed at between 90 mm/s and 125 mm/s on my Ultimaker and sliced with Cura.  Printed with PLA.  \nAssembling can be tricky.  It is helpful to &quot;press-stress&quot; the hinges by moving them back-and-forth with your fingers first to make them more flexible.  Make certain you have the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; aligned properly (not one hinge off) and both arrows are pointing in the same direction.  Start the hinge sort of like a zipper.  You cannot snap all of the hinge joints at once.  Start at an outside edge and work toward the opposite side.  I found it easier to insert one set of hinge &quot;dimples&quot; behind the opposite side (sort of like an interlocking comb) and then wiggle back-and-forth until the outside dimple moves into position and the continue wiggling until the rest pop into place.  I will plan to upload another model with fewer hinge connections to make this part easier.  At first, it doesn't seem like it will work, but after you figure out the technique, it should not take longer than one minute per hinge joint.  \nEnjoy!\n"}], "tags": [["HINGE", "tag:hinge"],
